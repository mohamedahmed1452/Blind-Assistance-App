Blind Assistance App

Created a comprehensive Android application designed to assist visually impaired users with two primary features:

Image Caption Generation: Utilizes advanced image recognition technology to provide real-time, descriptive captions for photos. This feature helps users understand the content of images by converting visual data into verbal descriptions.

Currency Classification: Identifies and classifies various currencies using the device’s camera. This feature enables users to easily recognize and differentiate between different denominations of money, enhancing their ability to manage transactions independently.

Additionally, the app includes voice navigation to facilitate seamless interaction. Users can navigate the app’s features and receive spoken feedback, making the app more accessible and user-friendly.
